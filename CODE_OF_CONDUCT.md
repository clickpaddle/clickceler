# ClickCeler Community Code of Conduct

Welcome to ClickCeler — a space for creative collaboration, technical learning, and open experimentation. This project is made by and for curious minds. To keep our community welcoming and productive for everyone, we ask that you follow this simple Code of Conduct.

## 🎯 Purpose

ClickCeler exists for **educational and experimental** purposes. You're encouraged to contribute ideas, try out features, and discuss real-world feasibility of innovations that fit the spirit of the project.

This is a safe space to **learn**, **build**, and **explore openly**.

## 🤝 Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and inclusive environment, we pledge to make participation in our community respectful for everyone — regardless of background, identity, or skill level.

We aim to:

- Encourage thoughtful collaboration
- Promote respectful feedback
- Welcome diverse perspectives
- Embrace constructive disagreement
- Support learning through experimentation

## ✅ Do

- Be kind, patient, and supportive
- Ask questions — no question is too "basic"
- Share your knowledge
- Respect the GPL license and give credit
- Focus on learning, not ego
- Discuss features and ideas with a mindset of exploration

## ❌ Don’t

- Harass, bully, or belittle others
- Use hateful or discriminatory language
- Spam, flood, or derail discussions
- Rehost, repackage, or recreate **ClickCeler** under a different name or repo pretending it’s a different project
- Abuse the open nature of the project (excessive PRs with no purpose, etc.)
- Violate the spirit of GPL: the code is open — not to be exploited, but to be reused and remixed responsibly

## 💡 About Feature Proposals

Got a wild idea? A half-baked concept? That’s great — ClickCeler is the place to share it in a branch!

Please:

- Tag such issues as `idea`, `exploration`, or `educational`
- Include context or reasoning for feasibility
- Link to examples or real-world inspirations when possible

## 📜 Licensing & Reuse

This project is protected under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**. You are welcome to **use**, **modify**, and **redistribute** the code **as long as your contributions respect the license** and acknowledge this repository as the source.

Please **do not recreate a competing GitHub repository with the same purpose or branding**. ClickCeler is meant to be a **shared base**, not a fragmented one.

## 🛡️ Reporting Issues

If you see behavior that violates this code or undermines the community spirit, you can report it privately to:

📧 **git@clickpaddle.com**

Reports will be handled discreetly and respectfully.

## 📚 Attribution
