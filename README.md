# JollyClick â€” Educational Event Management Expert System

## Overview

JollyClick is simple educational implementation inspired by early expert systems for event management. Its goal is to help new generations understand how event-driven expert systems were designed and operated, using logic programming (Prolog) and rule-based reasoning.

This project demonstrates the core concepts of:

- Representing events as structured facts  
- Applying rule phases such as enrich, reset, link, launch
- Using logic inference to reason on event data  
- Handling concurrent event inputs and queries via a simple server-client architecture  

It is not a production-ready system but a didactic tool to explore foundational ideas in expert systems and event or facts management.

## How It Works
  
- Events are modeled as Prolog facts with rich attributes: swipl on Linux/
- Rules written in Prolog are applied to update and correlate events.  
- A Python server receives event data (in JSON), asserts facts in Prolog, and allows queries: Python module pyswip  

This bridges modern application programming with classic logic-based reasoning engines.

## Usage

1. Load your events as JSON objects:   events.json
2. Convert them to Prolog facts using the provided Python scripts:   jollypost.py < events.json  
3. Define your own Prolog rules for event enrich, reset, link, launch, filter:   rules.pl
4. Run the server to accept events and queries over TCP:   jollyclick.py
5. Explore how logic rules process your events step by step:   jollyquery.py
